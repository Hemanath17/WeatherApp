## WeatherApp

Weather Application is an external API integrated web application which can allow the users to check for weather for a certain location.


## Django

Django framework will enable the web application which will interact with the Yahoo API to display the exact weather time.

YAHOO API - https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/

There were pretty huge weather based API tools which we could use but the Yahoo Weather API will enable the user to look for past 10 days of weather on that specific place for any other statistical resources.

## Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. 

Heroku will deploy the weather API into web based application.
